      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Boley and I'm a software engineer, ultramarathoner, dog dad, music enthusiast, list lover, and much more.</p>
      <img></img>
      <h1>My Many Hats</h1>
      <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
      <p>In 2022, I enrolled in Flatiron School's Full Stack Software Engineering program. Since then, I've developed applications and websites from wireframe to deployment, including this website. To check out <a>some of my projects</a> or learn more about <a>my tech skills</a>, feel free to look around.</p>
      <h2>Ultrarunner</h2>
      <p>One of my biggest passions is running. I love running on trails, up mountains, really anywhere. I've run the <a>NYC Marathon</a>, won a small <a>trail marathon</a>, and have run races up to <a>50 miles</a>. In July 2023, I'll be running my first 100 mile race, the <a>Vermont 100</a>.</p>
      <h2>Dog Dad</h2>
      <p>I have a golden retriever named Finn. He's a sweetheart!</p>

      <h2>Music Enthusiast</h2>
      <p>Another passion of mine is music! Though I can't play a single note, I love <a>attending concerts</a>, <a>collecting records</a>, and listening to music as much as I possibly can.</p>
      <h2>List Lover</h2>
      <p>If you haven't noticed by now, I absolutely LOVE lists. There's nothing more satisfying than adding to a good list or excel spreadsheet. <a>Favorite movies</a>, <a>top beers</a>, concerts I've attended, records I own. You name it, I've got a list!</p>
